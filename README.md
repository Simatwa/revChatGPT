## **Use Case**

1. Education and Learning:
   - **Use Case**: Educators or students interested in understanding how ChatGPT's interface works or teaching/learning web development.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a hands-on learning experience, exploring frontend development, API integration, and web technologies used in the ChatGPT interface.


2. Research and Development:
   - **Use Case**: Researchers or enthusiasts interested in analyzing, modifying, or extending the ChatGPT web interface.
   - **Benefit**: Supports studying conversational AI interfaces, user interactions, or conducting experiments in a controlled environment.

3. UI/UX Customization:
   - **Use Case**: Individuals who find the existing UI/UX not cool, they can come up with one that suits their tastes and preferences.
   - **Benefit**: Provides an opportunity to modify, adapt, or extend the interface to align with specific branding or UI/UX requirements

4. Privacy and Security:
   - **Use Case**: Concerned about data privacy or security, especially for sensitive conversations or testing confidential information.
   - **Benefit**: One gets to know which kind of data you're sharing with OpenAI in real time.

5. Localized Deployment:
   - **Use Case**: Operating in regions with restricted internet access or as part of an intranet system.
   - **Benefit**: Allows for localized deployment, ensuring access to the ChatGPT interface within specific network boundaries or regions with limited internet connectivity.

## Installation

- Clone repo and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/Simatwa/revChatGPT.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 

- You need cookies to bypass the login stage. That has been well documented in [WebChatGPT](https://github.com/Simatwa/WebChatGPT). Just in summary the doument reads:

The script utilizes [HTTP Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) and [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) to justify the REST-API requests at [Openai](https://openai.com). 

In order to do that, we will use the [export-cookie-for-puppeteer](https://github.com/ktty1220/export-cookie-for-puppeteer) extension to extract the cookies which will later on used to retrieve the OAuth.

### Procedure

1. Login to https://chat.openai.com
2. Upon successfull login, use **Export cookie JSON File Puppeteer** to export cookies. If you haven't installed the extension, here are  the quick installation links for you. 
 - [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nmckokihipjgplolmcmjakknndddifde)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%83%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BCjson%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E5%87%BA%E5%8A%9B-for-puppeteer/)

By doing that you are almost there.

Make path to the exported cookie file an environment variable identified by `openai_cookie_file` or  simply create a `.env` file at the projects root directory and save the path in the format :

`openai_cookie_file=<path-to-openai-cookie-file>`

> **Recommended** : Edit the [env](env) file as per your preferences and then rename it to *.env*

Fire up the server locally:

`python -m flask run -p 8000`

Then visit http://localhost:8000 .

> **Note** : The server has been tweaked to be relevant only on localhost using port 8000.

Have fun.
